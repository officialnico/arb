# Arbitrage oppurtinity seeker and performer

## The purpose of this project is to create a bot that identifies and profits off of arbitrage oppertunities in the volotile crypto markets. The project will have the following phases:

**Phase 1:**
Identification of oppertunities. 

The program is run every few seconds and detects profitable price differences on two crypto markets. Once the price difference is identified, the program logs the event in a .xlsx file. Costs associated with transactions NEED TO BE CONSIDERED! These include trading, deposit and withdrawal fees.

**Phase 2:**
Micro trading

The program is able to execute identified oppertunities on the markets. Initially this will be done through small trades of values like _10USD_. Hopefully at this stage it will start generating profit.

**Phase 3**
To be determined...

## Exchanges
Initially, oppertunities will be identified on **Kraken** and **Bittrex**.
